# Hotel Management System

A hotel is a busy place with lots of things going on at the same time. People check in and out, book rooms, eat at the restaurant, and more. Trying to keep track of all this manually is really hard. That's why we need a computer system to help us manage everything. This system is often called a Property Management System (PMS) or Hotel ERP. It does a bunch of tasks automatically to make the hotel work smoothly.
